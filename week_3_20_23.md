# Protocol Protocol Week 3/20/23

For this week I have some tasks listed out for each team below. This list of goals I’m hoping will will complete by the end of the week - if you finish ahead of time and are looking for more items to do let me know :).

## Website Team:

### Details:

This week’s goal will be to bring the wireframe that you created last week to life.

The website will be first built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After we’re happy with it, we can SUPER easily transfer it to a framework like react (at a later point in time).


### Goals:

#### Subgoal 1: Learning About Websites

* Create a [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) account
* Complete the "Site Structure" section of the Codecademy course "How to Make a Website with NameCheap" (you don't need to complete the project)
* Note: reference and continue this^ course whenever you're stuck, it has everything you'll need to complete the site.

#### Subgoal 2: Building Websites

* Checkout the main branch (run the following commands: "git fetch", "git checkout main")
* In “website\website-v1\main\index.HTML” follow the quickstart guide here: [bootstrap quickstart](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and change what displays on the page to "Hello World <your name>". (then make a commit of your work)
* Using divs, write out the structure of the site; you can use my "component layout" below as a reference/inspiration. (then make a commit of your work (feel free to make some during if appropriate))
* Use [bootstraps docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) to start replacing divs/components of the site that you made in the previous step (e.g. Navbar, buttons, etc..). (make commits where appropriate while adding components)

#### Notes:

* Bootstrap is already downloaded on the main branch, all you need to do is edit the index. 
* If you need any git or website help, Zhi is a great resource.
* I looked thoroughly through the wireframes that the both you worked on last meeting, and it’s great work! I’m looking forward to seeing it come to life.

## Simulation Team:

### Details:

This week, a lot of the focus will be on the design and documentation of the simulation portion of the website.

### Goals:

* Add spacing in between the messages displayed in the json format (they are currently concatenated, each message should have a space in between them, possibly add brackets around each message too?) (modify the wire.py)
* Add descriptive comments to the top of each of the files (wire.py, main.py, device.py)
* Create a readme of the assumptions and overview of the step-states based simulation model that’s in-use.
* Create issues on github of what will be needed for the project to achieve our goals for this semester
* Zhi’s task: add the “ability” to model/use the device as a finite state machine. This goal is designed to be open and allow you to use many different approaches to achieve it. The purpose of this would be to allow for programmers to “easily” implement of devices as agents that exhibit the behaoir of a party in a protocol. Make sure that your implementation is able to fit within the current program arrangement with minimal changes(ideally just add to device.py) - One approach I’m fond of is using polymorphism to have a RIP-device (RIP is a routing protocol). When building this, think of routing protocols; each “agent” has the same algorithm that they are running, but when combined emergent behavoir forms. If you have thoughts or questions, please reach out. Since this is a larger tasks, be sure to make commits along the way so there is a history of the various approaches you took if your direction changes at any time.

## Post Notes:

This week I'll be away at a conference (National Conference for the National Society of Black Engineers), so I may be a bit slower in responding. But I'm confident in each everyone's skills and am sure that we'll be able to complete strong milestones before the end of the semester!
